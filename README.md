## About

My interests span a range of machine learning facets including computer vision/deep learning, time-series forecasting, and model interpretability and uncertainty. My applied experience lies in the implementation of healthcare solutions through MRI scans and bioinformaticdata. While my main interests now lie in data, through my electrical engineering background, I have a fundamental understanding, and passion, of signals processing and power distribution.
